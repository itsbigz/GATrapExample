# GATrapExample
Using the previously implemented genetic algorithm, I am trying to solve a 3-bit hierarchical trap for 27 and 81 bit strings. How do I count the fitness in hierarchical trap? Contribution function: what each block contributes to the total fitness In low levels: flow = fhigh = 1 multiplied by 3^height(x) In high level: flow = 0.8 and fhigh = 1 multiplied by 3^height(x) Interpretation function:  111 -> 1    000->0    others-> -1
